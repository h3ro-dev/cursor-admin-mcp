  **🎮 The Team Analytics Power-Up for Your AI Assistant**

## 🚀 Quick Install

```bash
npx -y cursor-admin-mcp
```

That's it. Your AI assistant just leveled up.

## 🎯 What You Get

Think of this as equipping your AI with X-ray vision for your development team:

- **🏢 Team Roster** - Instantly know who's on the team and their roles
- **📊 Usage Analytics** - See who's actually coding vs. who's in meetings
- **💰 Credit Tracker** - Know exactly where your AI credits are going
- **📈 Productivity Metrics** - Lines added, AI acceptance rates, favorite models
- **🔍 Deep Insights** - Which developer uses which tools, when they're most active

## 💪 Why This Matters

Stop asking your team for status updates. Your AI can now tell you:
- "Who wrote the most code this week?"
- "What's our AI spending trend?"
- "Which team member has the highest AI acceptance rate?"
- "Show me usage patterns for the last month"

## 📸 See It In Action

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// The MCP server handles all the communication
// Just use natural language in Claude/Cursor:

"Show me all team members and their roles"
"Get usage data for January 2024"
"What's our team's total spending this month?"
"Show me the AI acceptance rate trend for the last 30 days"
```

### Advanced Queries

```typescript
// Complex date ranges
"Compare usage between last week and this week"

// Specific metrics
"Which team members have the highest AI suggestion acceptance rate?"

// Spending analysis
"Show me spending sorted by amount for team members whose name contains 'John'"
```

## Error Handling

The server includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Invalid API Key**: Clear error message if authentication fails
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects Cursor API rate limits
- **Date Validation**: Ensures date ranges don't exceed 90 days
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- **Invalid Parameters**: Detailed validation messages

## Security

- API keys are never logged or exposed
- All communication uses HTTPS
- Basic authentication as per Cursor API requirements
- Environment variables for sensitive data
