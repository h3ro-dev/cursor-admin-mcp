## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

### Code Formatting

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

npm run lint
```

### File Organization

- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Group related functionality
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Follow the existing directory structure

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
